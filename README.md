# 🛑✨ Alex's list to remove clutter from websites ✨🛑

This repository hosts [a curated list of uBlock Origin rules](alexanderadam.txt) designed to enhance your browsing experience by blocking ads, trackers, and other unwanted web content. 🚫🕵️‍♂️
While it should be compatible to [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) it probably works with other AdBlockers, too.

Have a look at the [📜 installation instructions](https://alexanderadam.github.io/adblock_list/#installation) to get started! 🚀

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

The rules might change the display of websites significantly.
Things might not work as expected, and some websites might not work at all.
If you encounter any issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/alexanderadam/adblock_list/issues/new) with a detailed description of the problem, including the URL of the website and screenshots if possible. 📝📸
You will find the affected hosts [here](hosts.md). 🌐
